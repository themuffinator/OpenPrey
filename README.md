## About

**OpenPREY** is a free, open-source replacement for **PREY (2006)** that brings your classic game into the modern era. Built on the shoulders of Quake4Doom, it keeps everything you love about the original — the brutal combat, the tight gameplay, the iconic atmosphere — and layers on a fresh set of visuals and quality-of-life upgrades that make it feel right at home on today's hardware.

Plug in a controller and play from the couch, enjoy crisp widescreen and ultrawide support, or push the visuals further with HDR rendering, dynamic shadow maps, and a suite of post-processing effects. The best part? It all runs on your existing copy of PREY — no new assets, no subscription, just your game looking and playing better than ever.

**OpenPREY** is under active development, with a maintained Issues tracker. Despite the remaining issues, it provides what is to date by far the most developed and refined custom source port available.

Run your existing copy of Prey on modern hardware across **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS** — without changing the game you remember.

> [!NOTE]
> **OpenPrey does not include game assets.** You must own a legitimate copy of Prey (2006) to play. On Windows, `fs_basepath` auto-discovery checks the current working directory, registry install entries (including App Paths and uninstall metadata), and known legacy install roots such as `Human Head Studios/Prey`, `2K Games/Prey`, and `Games/Prey`.

---

## Features

### PREY Compatibility
- **Unified Game Module Model** — Engine loads `game_<arch>` for both SP and MP paths, with legacy `gamex86`/`gamex64` aliases accepted during migration
- **Legacy Install Discovery** — Windows install detection covers CD-era registry keys, App Paths, uninstall entries, and known install roots without assuming Steam/GOG-only layouts
- **Official Asset Validation** — Startup validation checks the required official Prey base PK4 layout before the game runs

### Modern Platform and Tooling
- **SDL3-first Windows Backend** — SDL3 is the default window, input, and display backend; the legacy Win32 backend remains as a transitional fallback
- **Meson + Ninja Build System** — Canonical configure/build/install path with repo-local staging under `.install/`
- **Cross-platform Nightly Builds** — GitHub Actions builds and packages Windows, Linux, and macOS artifacts from the same Meson staging flow
- **Crash Diagnostics** — Windows debug builds write crash logs and minidumps into `crashes/` beside the executable

### Display and Runtime
- **Modern Window Modes** — Windowed, borderless, desktop-native fullscreen, and exclusive fullscreen all supported
- **Monitor Selection** — SDL3 builds expose `r_screen`, `listDisplays`, and `listDisplayModes` for multi-monitor setup
- **Aspect Ratio and FOV** — Automatically derived from the current render size; no manual aspect-ratio setting needed

## Installation

### Step 1 — Get PREY (2006)

You need a copy of **PREY (2006)** installed from original media or another legitimate distribution. OpenPREY supports CD-era install layouts.

### Step 2 — Download the latest OpenPREY release

Head to the **[Releases page](https://github.com/themuffinator/OpenPREY/releases)** and download the latest archive for your platform (Windows, Linux, or macOS).

### Step 3 — Extract

Unzip or unpack the archive to any folder you like.

### Step 4 — Play

Launch `OpenPREY-client_x64` (that's `OpenPREY-client_x64.exe` on Windows). OpenPREY will find your PREY (2006) installation automatically in most cases.

> [!NOTE]
> **Windows players:** The package is self-contained — no extra software needs to be installed.

> [!NOTE]
> **Linux players:** OpenPREY currently runs through XWayland on Wayland desktops. Make sure `DISPLAY` is set in your environment.

> [!TIP]
> If OpenPrey can't find your PREY installation automatically, launch with `+set fs_basepath "C:\path\to\PREY"`. See the [manual path configuration](TECHNICAL.md#manual-path-configuration) section in the technical reference.
